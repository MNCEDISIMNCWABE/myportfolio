    "#### Understanding AI Agents and Tools\n",
    "AI agents are specialized programs or models designed to perform tasks autonomously using artificial intelligence techniques, often mimicking human decision-making, reasoning, and learning. They interact with users or systems, learn from data, adapt to new information, and execute specific functions within a defined scope, like customer support, process automation, or complex data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, tasks rarely have single-step solutions. Instead, they typically involve a series of interconnected and standalone steps to be carried out. For example, for a question like –\n",
    "\n",
    "“Which coffee had the highest sales in our Manhattan based store?” might have a single step answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for a question like –\n",
    "\n",
    "“Which 3 coffee types would be liked by our customer Emily who works at Google, NYC office? She prefers low calories coffee and likes Lattes more than Cappuccinos. Also could you send a mail to her with a promotional campaign for these 3 coffee types mentioning the nearest location of our store to her office where she can grab these?”\n",
    "\n",
    "A single LLM would not be able to handle such a complex query by itself and this is where the need for an AI agent consisting of multiple LLMs arises.\n",
    "\n",
    "For handling such complex tasks, instead of prompting a single LLM, multiple LLMs can be combined together acting as AI agents to break the complex task into multiple independent tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Task:\n",
    "We want to create a team of agents to write posts about a given topic. \n",
    "There will be two agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Researcher Agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- This agent focuses on gathering accurate and relevant information about the specified topic from the internet. To enhance its capabilities, it uses the serper.dev API, which integrates with the Google Search API to deliver precise and up-to-date search results.\n",
    "- The agent collects and compiles useful data, statistics, case studies, and examples related to the topic at hand. For instance, we will focus on the topic \"The Most Interesting Applications of AI in Interior Design in 2024,\" the researcher agent will explore current trends, tools, and real-world case studies where AI has impacted interior design.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Writer Agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the researcher agent gathers the necessary information about the topic, the writer agent takes over to compose a well-structured and engaging blog post. \n",
    "- It uses the insights and data provided by the researcher agent to craft an article that captures the reader's attention, explains complex ideas in an accessible manner, and highlights the most compelling examples and use cases."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "#### Technologies Used and Their Functions\n",
    "##### ChatOpenAI LLM :\n",
    "- A large language model (in this case we are using llama-3.2-3b-instruct) used for natural language understanding and generation. \n",
    "- Provides the intelligence behind the agents for generating text and executing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Crew AI Framework (Crew, Agent, Task):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Crew: Manages the overall workflow and coordinates tasks among agents.\n",
    "- Agent: Defines specific roles (e.g., researcher, writer) with goals, tools, and constraints.\n",
    "- Task: Specifies the objectives and steps for each agent to perform, such as researching or writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Serper API / Custom Tools (SearchTools.search_internet):\n",
    "- A tool integrated for internet searches, allowing the agents to gather information online (uses the serper.dev API for Google search functionality).\n",
    "- The Researcher Agent uses the internet search tool to collect insights about AI applications in interior design.\n",
    "- The Writer Agent takes the research and crafts a compelling blog post based on the gathered data.\n",
    "##### Workflow Design:\n",
    "- Tasks are executed sequentially, ensuring the researcher completes their task before the writer begins. Each task has clear descriptions, steps, and expected outputs."
