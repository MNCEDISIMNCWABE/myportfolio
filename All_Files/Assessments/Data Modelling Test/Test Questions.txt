Welcome!

For Q1 please edit the model in the .pbix file.
For Q2,3 and 4, please place cards and graphs to answer the questions and try to style the answer dashboard mildly.

Q1. Denormalize to 3rd normal form (Star Schema)
There may be no snowflaked dimensions, and no circular relationships.

Q2. Which SpecialOfferID had the highest number of ordered units?

Q3. Which PersonID used the special offers the most, and how many was that?
Hint - Since Customer and SpecialOffer are unrelated, 
	you may need to use the RELATED function in the fact table to get the right figure

Q4. Create a measure for the result of Q3 (Number of Special offers used by Customers), 
	and display a visual that shows a trend of the number of special offers used by a specific person over time. 
	*Include a filter for PersonID and a date slider using the correct date field.


Notes/Assumptions:

Performance is not a concern, any way to get to the right answers is acceptable.
