      "Taxation may involve payments to a minimum of two different levels of government: central government through SARS or to local government. Prior to 2001 the South African tax system was \"source-based\", where in income is taxed in the country where it originates. Since January 2001, the tax system was changed to \"residence-based\" wherein taxpayers residing in South Africa are taxed on their income irrespective of its source. Non residents are only subject to domestic taxes.\n",
      "Central government revenues come primarily from income tax, value added tax (VAT) and corporation tax. Local government revenues come primarily from grants from central government funds and municipal rates. In the 2018/19 fiscal year SARS collected R 1 287.7 billion (equivalent to US$ 86.4 billion) in tax revenue, a figure R71.2 billion (or 5.8%) more than that from the previous fiscal year.\n",
      "In 2018/19 financial year, South Africa had a tax-to-GDP ratio of 26.2% that was only slightly more than the 25.9% in 2017/18. The cost of collecting tax revenue has remained somewhat constant; decreasing slightly from 0.93% of total revenue in 2016/17 to 0.89% in 2017/18, while the 2018/19 financial year showed a further improvement in the cost of revenue collection, which dropped to 0.84%.\n",
      "Three of the provinces of South Africa contributed 77.8% of the total tax revenue: Gauteng (49.0%), Western Cape (15.5%), and KwaZulu-Natal (13.3%). The provinces with the smallest contributions were the Northern Cape (1.3%), followed by Free State (3.2%) and North West (3.3%) \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Overview ==\n",
      "The South African Revenue Service (SARS) is responsible for the collection of taxes within the Republic of South Africa. The mandate and vision of the South African Revenue Service, quoted from their website, is to:\n",
      "\n",
      "Collect all revenues due.\n",
      "Ensure optimal compliance with Tax, Customs and Excise legislation.\n",
      "Provide a customs and excise service that will facilitate legitimate trade as well as protect our economy and society.\n",
      "SARS is driven by the aspiration to contribute directly to the economic and social development of the country by collecting the revenue due to enable government to deliver on its constitutional obligations, policy and delivery priorities in pursuance of better life for all in South Africa. By encouraging tax and customs compliance, we also aspire to contribute to the building of fiscal citizenship reflected by a law abiding society.\n",
      "The anchor for SARS to deliver on this mandate is the higher purpose and values which drives and informs all SARS employees' behaviour.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Number of taxpayers ===\n",
      "On 31 March 2019, the tax register of SARS had in excess of 26 million entries, excluding the following: 1) those cases where the persons or entities were suspended; 2) estates; and 3) entities with unknown addresses. Individuals made up 79% of the entries with an aggregate income of R1.7 trillion.  The tax register increased to more than 27 million entries for 2020.\n",
      "In 2019, of the 22.1 million individual taxpayers only 6.6 million (31%) were expected to submit tax returns, while in 2020 the number of individual tax payers increased to 22.9 million but the number expected to submit tax returns fell to 6.3 million (27.5%).\n",
      "Furthermore, in 2019 only 4.9 million taxpayers (23%) submitted returns and were assessed. Of the assessed taxpayers only 882 000 (18%) owed SARS some tax, 11.3% had a zero assessment and 70.7% received refunds. Furthermore, of the 4.9 million assessed tax payers 1.9 million (40.2%) were from the Gauteng province and 1.3 million (27.3%) were in the 35 – 44 age bracket.\n",

      "=== Categories of Tax ===\n",
      "Direct taxes are taxes which are imposed on individuals, trusts, deceased estates, companies and close corporations; all of whom are otherwise known as persons. Indirect taxes are collected by an intermediary from the person who bears the ultimate economic burden of the tax. The intermediary later files a tax return and forwards the tax proceeds to government with the return. Of the R1 216 billion collected by SARS in 2017/2018, 93% (or R1 133 billion) came from taxes on both Personal and Company Income and Profits, and taxes on Domestic Goods and Services, a combination of both direct and indirect taxes.\n",

      "submit a tax return or document to SARS; or\n",
      "fail to issue a document to a person as needed; or\n",
      "fail to register or amend a registration in the instance where registered details have changed; or\n",

      "Income tax in South Africa was first introduced in 1914 with the introduction of the Income Tax Act No 28, an act that had its origins in the New South Wales Act of 1895. The act has gone through numerous amendments with the act presently in force is the Income Tax Act No 58 of 1962 which contains provisions for four different types of income tax. These four types of tax are:\n",
      "\n",
      "normal tax\n",
      "donations tax\n",
      "secondary tax on companies\n",
      "withholding tax\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Capital gains tax ===\n",
      "Capital gains Tax (CGT) includes all profits acquired from the sale of capital assets such as vehicles, real estates and others. Capital Gains are only taxable when the capital assets are sold or disposed of and are included in an individual or companies taxable income.\n",
      "First introduced on 1 October 2001, capital gains tax is effectively charged by adding a percentage of the increase in value of an asset, that was disposed of for more than its base cost, to the taxpayer's taxable income (see normal tax). For individuals, deceased estates and special trusts 40% of the net gain exceeding R 40 000 exclusion for individuals is added to their taxable income. For companies, close corporations and trusts 80% is added. Net capital losses in any given year cannot be used as a set-off against ordinary income; but can be carried forward to the following years to be used as a set-off against future capital gains\n",
      "Capital gains tax is not payable on money or property inherited. If there is CGT payable it is usually the estate which is held liable. (See Inheritance Tax).\n",
      "SARS determines capital gain (or loss) on the disposal of an asset relative to the base cost of the asset. For most assets, the base cost is the price at which the asset was purchased. If the asset was held before 1 October 2001, the base cost is deemed to be the assessed value of the asset on 1 October 2001. Any profit made on the disposal of the asset would then be the capital gain.\n",
      "There are a few exceptions.\n",
      "Example 1: When shares are bought and sold the profit made from the disposal of the shares might be deemed by SARS to be capital in nature, or income in nature. If the disposal is capital in nature only 40% for natural person (80% for companies) of the profit is added to taxable income. If the disposal is deemed to be income then 100% is added to taxable income. The determining factor for SARS in this instance is the intention behind the purchase of the shares. Generally, SARS views profit on the disposal of any shares held for more than 3 years to be capital in nature.\n",
      "Example 2: Investments in Venture Capital (VC) Companies (so-called Section 12J Companies) are exempt from taxation at the time of the investment. After the period of investment the VC company will return the initial investment plus (or minus) any profit (or loss). In this instance, the base cost of the investment is deemed by SARS to be R0 (zero Rand). This means that the entire initial investment and any profit on disposal is subject to GCT.\n",
      "In line with the changes in tax residence implemented with the 2019/20 budget, taxation of capital gains has become of greater interest. For resident taxpayers earning in excess of R1 million from offshore sources, the only means to legally avoid the 45% tax is to emigrate one's tax status. One effect of this process is the immediate triggering of capital gains tax liability on all assets the taxpayer has in South Africa. Capital gains taxation is triggered when an asset is disposed of by:\n",
      "\n",
      "sale;\n",
      "loss;\n",
      "donation;\n",
      "exchange;\n",
      "the death of the tax payer;\n",
      "the physical emigration of the taxpayer; or\n",
      "the tax emigration of the taxpayer.\n",
      "The specific exclusions of capital gains tax, namely:\n",
      "\n",
      "R2 million gain (or loss) on disposal of a primary residence;\n",
      "personal use assets;\n",
      "retirement benefits;\n",
      "payments made in respect of long term insurance policies;\n",
      "R40 000 annual exclusion of capital gains (or loss) for individuals and special trusts;\n",
      "R300 000 once-off exclusion on death of individuals in the year of death. This replaces the annual exclusion;\n",
      "R1.8 million once-off exclusion on disposal of small businesses under R10 million\n",
      "apply to tax emigration.\n",
      "Maximum effective tax rates for Capital gains remain:\n",
      "\n",
      "18% for individuals and special trusts;\n",
      "22.4% for companies; and\n",
      "36% for other trusts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Company income tax ===\n",
      "The company income tax rate is levied at 28% (According to the Company Law No. 71 of 2008, as amended) of the taxable income of the company. This was not changed in the 2018/19 Budget. Certain companies qualify as a small business corporation (see tax table below).  Employment companies pay a tax of 33%. Dividends were subject to an additional tax called the Secondary Tax on Companies which was 10% of declared dividends. This tax was replaced by Dividend Tax on 1 April 2012; however Secondary Tax on Companies credits was still used by some companies until 31 March 2015. Again the lowest tax bracket for Small Business Corporations was adjusted in the 2020/21 budget, creating a small tax saving for these businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2017/18 tax year 24.2% (993 069) of 3.7 million companies in South Africa had taxable income.  Of them, 57.7% of the tax was paid by 370 large companies (0.2% of all companies) with a taxable income in excess of R200 million.  Around 70% of the tax collected was from the finance, manufacturing, and retail and wholesale trade sectors.  In 2017/18 the mining and quarrying sector represented only 0.7% of all companies in South Africa and provided 7.2% of the assessed tax, reflecting the declining importance of the mining sector to the South African economy\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Dividends tax ===\n",
      "Dividends Tax is a policy tax imposed by government with the aim of encouraging companies to retain profits instead of giving out dividends. It takes the form of a 20% tax on receipt of dividends given by companies and closed corporations. With the imposition of a highest income tax bracket of 45% on individuals, dividends tax was increased at the same time to prevent capital gains tax vs dividends tax arbitrage situations involving high net worth individuals.\n",
      "Prior to 1 April 2012 this tax was known as the Secondary Tax on Companies and took the form of a 10% tax on the net dividend distributed by companies and closed corporations.\n",
      "Dividends tax is considered a form of Withholding tax. An annual exemption of R23,800 (for taxpayers under 65 years) and R34,500 (for taxpayers 65 and over) applies to Dividends tax. From 1 March 2012 the exemption on foreign dividends earned by South African residents was scrapped.\n",
      "The dividends received by South African resident individuals from REITs are subject to income tax, not dividends tax. Non-residents receiving those dividends are subject only to dividend tax.\n",
      "Foreign dividends earned by South African resident individuals, where such individuals own less than 10% of the foreign shareholding of that company, is taxable at \"a maximum effective rate of 20%.\"\n",
      "No changes was made with regards to dividends in the 2020/21 Budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Donations tax ===\n",
      "Tax on donations is linked to Estate Duty which was first introduced in South Africa in 1955. It is not a tax on income but rather on the transfer of wealth but differs from estate duty in that it specifically taxes gifts and donations as opposed to inheritance. As of 1 March 2018, this tax subjects cumulative donations in excess of R30 million made by persons to a flat rate of 25%. Natural persons have an annual exemption of R100 000. For taxpayers who are not natural persons, the exempt donations are limited to casual gifts not exceeding R10 000 per annum in total. Donations between spouses, South African group companies and donations to certain public benefit organisations are exempt from donations tax.\n",
      "See also Inheritance tax / Estate duty and Donation tax deduction\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Environmental Taxes ===\n",
      "The South African Government has responded to the global challenge of climate change by introducing several environmental taxes. These are intended to\n",
      "modify the behaviour of the country's citizens. Taxes on international trade and transactions (including the Diamond Export levy) are sometimes also included in this category.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== CO2 tax on motor vehicle emissions ====\n",
      "The aim of this tax is to encourage owners of motor vehicles in South Africa to become more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. The tax is charged on the mass of CO2 gas emitted per km driven, specifically each gram of CO2 emitted above 120g CO2 per km driven. This tax was introduced in September 2010 for passenger vehicles at R75 and increased to R90 in 2013, R100 in 2016 and R110 in April 2018.\n",
      "For double-cab vehicles the tax is on CO2 emitted above 175g CO2 per km driven. The tax was introduced in March 2011 at R100 and increased to R125 in 2013, R140 in 2016 and R150 in April 2018. This levy generated R1.39 billion in the 2018/19 period.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Electricity levy ====\n",
      "This tax applies to electricity generated from non-renewable sources and was introduced in July 2009 at a rate of 2 cents per kWh. The levy was increased in July 2012 to 3.5 cents per kWh. In 2018/19 the tax income for this levy was R8.4 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Health Promotion levy ====\n",
      "On 1 April 2018 this tax was imposed on sugary beverages \"in support of the Department of Health's deliverable to decrease diabetes, obesity and other related diseases.\" It applies to beverages with more than 4g of sugar per 100ml and is payable by the manufacturers. It is a domestic consumption tax and therefore does not apply to sugary beverages that are locally produced for export (or as part of other exported goods). It is payable on goods imported into South Africa for local consumption. It generated R3.25 billion in the 2018/19 period, with levies on imports accounting for only 1.6% of that figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Incandescent light bulb levy ====\n",
      "This tax seeks to promote energy efficiency and reduce electricity demand by encouraging the use of energy saving light bulbs. On 1 November 2009 this tax was introduced at a rate of R3 per bulb. The tax was increased to R4 in April 2013, R6 in April 2016 and R8 per bulb in April 2018. R41 million was generated by this levy in 2018/19.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== International air passenger departure tax ====\n",
      "This tax is imposed on international air travel. It was introduced in November 2000 at a rate of either R50 or R100 per passenger depending on their international destination. On 1 October 2011 the departure tax rate was changed to R190 per passenger on all international flights, excluding those to Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Eswatini which are taxed at R100.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Plastic bag levy ====\n",
      "This tax was aimed at reducing litter and encouraging plastic bag reuse and recycling. In June 2004, the plastic bag levy was introduced at a rate of 3 cents a bag on some types of plastic shopping bags. The levy was increased to 4 cents from April 2009, 6 cents from April 2013, 8 cents from April 2016 and 12 cents from April 2018. From 1 April 2018 it was increased to 12 cents per bag and created a tax income in the 2018/19 tax year of R300 million. The 2020/21 budget saw the levy increase to 25 cents per bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "==== Tyre levy ====\n",
      "This tax was implement on 1 February 2017 with the aim of reducing waste and/or disposal into landfills while also encouraging reuse, treatment and recycling of pneumatic tyres. All new tyres are subject to the levy (payable by the manufacturers) which is calculated on the nett mass of the tyre. In 2018/19 the tyre levy generated R730 million in taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Exchange Controls ===\n",
      "Exchange controls relate to two broad areas:\n",
      "1) Transactions involving foreign currency purchases or sales. Such transactions are recorded by financial institutions and submitted to SARS. Taxpayers are required abide by the limits imposed on the transaction of foreign currency. On 5 November 2010 the lifetime limit for individuals of R4 million was replaced with an annual limit. On 1 April 2015 the annual limit was increased to R10 million. Taxpayers who desire to transact in excess of the annual limit may apply to SARS for clearance to do so. On emigration, the limits are from R8 million to R20 million per family unit.\n",
      "2) Direct foreign investments, which are often mediated by the DTI. BEE policies from 15 February 2006 require South African corporates and certain parastatals to have at least a 25% interest in these investments. Such investments generally require large transactions involving foreign currency and are subject to exchange controls. As from 1 April 2015, authorised companies may process corporate investments of up to R 1 billion per year, as well as carrying forward any unused allowances from previous years.\n",
      "As from 1 April 2015, credit cards for both corporates and individuals may be used for foreign transactions.\n",
      "In the past several decades South Africans had accumulated illegal offshore income and assets. From June 2003 to February 2004 an exchange control amnesty was implemented which allowed such individuals the opportunity to \"regularise\" their affairs. This amnesty would have had the dual outcomes of broadening the tax base and regularising taxpayers' affairs without prosecution. 42 672 applications were reviewed covering assets totalling R 68.6 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Expatriates tax ===\n",
      "A major change to the residence-based tax system was implemented with the 2019/20 budget. Previously the standard for the residence basis of taxation was 181 days, i.e. if a taxpayer was not present in South Africa for 181 days in any 12-month period they would not be considered resident in South Africa for tax purposes. The change in 2019/20 budget sees South African residents who are working overseas as residing in South Africa irrespective of the number of days they are physically present in South Africa.\n",
      "Such taxpayers are subject to 45% tax on any foreign income earned in excess of R1 million. Income includes remuneration, interest, dividends and fringe benefits. This is applicable to individuals, companies, close corporations, trusts and estates and is subject to foreign tax credit where applicable dual taxation agreements are in force.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Foreign entertainers and sportpersons ===\n",

      "Generally a fringe benefit of 3.5% of the determined value (cash cost plus VAT) of the vehicle per month is added to the taxpayer's remuneration. However, if the vehicle is covered by a maintenance plan this benefit is reduced to 3.25%. If the vehicle is obtained under lease, the determined monthly value is the monthly cost under the lease plus the cost of fuel.\n",
      "As with a travelling allowance, 80% of the fringe benefit is included in the taxpayer's remuneration, unless the vehicle is used for business purposes at least 80% of the time, then the percentage is reduced to 20%. The fringe benefit is further reduced by the ratio of the annual distance travelled for business versus the total distance travelled annually as substantiated by a log book.\n",

      "The Fuel levy, also known as \"General Fuel Levy\" is a tax payable by the licensed manufacturers of petroleum products within South Africa. Petroleum products include petrol, diesel, kerosene (household paraffin) and biodiesel. If consumed within the RSA these products are also subject to Excise Duty and the Road Accident Fund (RAF) levy. In April 2018, the fuel levy was R3.37 per litre, which represented 23.7% of the price of 93 octane fuel (inland).\n",
      "The Road Accident Fund is a state insurer that provides insurance cover to all drivers of motor vehicles in South Africa in respect of liability incurred or damage caused as a result of a traffic collision. In April 2018 the road accident fund (RAF) contribution to the fuel price was R1.93 or 13.6%.\n",
      "The diesel refund system was introduced on 4 July 2001 as a way to promote international competitiveness in the fishing, farming, forestry and mining industries. On 1 October 2007 the scheme was extended to include electricity generation for peak demand where the power plants in question used petroleum fuels and generated in excess of 200MW. The purpose to which the fuel is employed determines the diesel refund rate. For example, farmers are entitled to 100% refund of the RAF levy. The rates are adjusted annually. The refunds are administered via the VAT system and are offset against VAT payable.\n",

      "Individual income tax (otherwise known as Personal income tax) rates in South Africa range from 18% to 45% although the tax threshold of R78 150 (for persons below age 65) means that anyone earning less than this amount pays no income tax. Individuals earning less than R78 150 (2018) a year do not need to declare their income and do not need to submit an income tax return so long as their remuneration is from a single employer, their remuneration is for the full tax year and no allowance was paid, from which PAYE was not deducted in full with regards to travel allowance.\n",

      "In 2015/16 financial year out of a total 33 million eligible taxpayers around 10% or 3.3 million people paid 93% of total income tax collected in that period. Of them, 1.1 million or 3.7% of all income taxpayers paid just under 70% of all income tax collected in that period. This means that South African income tax receipts are highly reliant on a relatively small number of high income taxpayers.\n",
      "In comparison, in the 2017/18 financial year the South African population was 56.7 million, of which 4.9 million people (8.6%) were taxpayers. Of these, 1.7 million or 39% of all income taxpayers paid just under 91% of all income tax collected in that period. This means that the tax burden is being spread amongst a larger group than the previous year, but that the tax base is still very small.\n",
      "In the 2007/8 financial year there were 1219 individuals who earned in excess of R5 million per annum. In the 2017/18 financial year that number had not changed but their total income had dropped from R11.39 billion to R11.28 billion (a decrease of 0.9%) while the tax they paid (39.4% effective) increased by R21 million (an increase of 0.5%).\n",

      "Inheritance tax is also referred to as Estate Duty and is a tax on Deceased Estates. Estate duty is similar to donations tax in that it is a tax on the transfer of wealth. The duty is charged on the death of a person and is based on the value of the deceased's estate at the date of their death.\n",
      "There are three statutes governing inheritances in South Africa:\n",

      "The Administration of Estates Act, which regulates the disposal of the deceased's estate in South Africa;\n",
      "The Wills Act, which affects all testators with property in South Africa;\n",
      "The Intestate Succession Act, covering the estates for all deceased persons who have property in South Africa and who die without a will.\n",
      "Inheritance tax applies to any person who owns property within South Africa.  On death, all of a deceased person's assets are placed in a deceased estate. These assets may include both movable and immovable property. On finalisation of the administration of the deceased estate, the executor distributes the remaining assets to the beneficiaries. Beneficiaries are either legatees (who receive a specific asset) or heirs (who receive the balance after disposal to legatees).\n",
      "Estate duty is intended to tax the transfer of wealth from the deceased estate to the beneficiaries. The tax is levied on the gross value of the assets (in excess of R3.5 million) of the deceased person at the time of death, less any allowable deductions. These deductions include bequests to public benefit organisations and property accruing to a surviving spouse. The amount of tax levied on the estate can be affected by applicable tax rebates and recovery of tax from beneficiaries where applicable. If, for example, a financial instrument such as a life insurance policy which is part of the estate is payable directly to a beneficiary, the policy amount is not included in the gross value of the deceased estate and the beneficiary of the policy becomes liable for the estate duty on the policy.\n",
      "Assets inherited are deemed a capital receipt and are not included in the taxpayers gross income. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) is not payable on receipt of an inheritance though it is generally payable by the deceased estate.\n",
      "On 21 February 2018 Estate Duty was set at 20% for estates of up to R30 million and 25% on the excess.\n",
      "Any income received by the deceased estate from the time it comes into existence until the distribution of the assets to the beneficiaries is dealt with under Section 25 of the Income Tax Act.\n",
      "Donations from within an estate are treated as normal donations (see Donations tax) and taxed as such.\n",

This was amended in the 2018/19 Budget to exempt non-residents who were out of the country for at least 181 days from income tax. Interest earned by non-residents is exempt from taxation if it is payable by any sphere of the South African government or a bank or if the debt is listed on a recognised exchange. (See also Withholding tax)\n",
      "In the 2020/21 budget the interest earned by any non-resident of South Africa, who is absent for 183 days, and if the interest bearing debt is not \"effectively connected\" to a South African business is exempt from income tax.\n",

Securities Transfer Tax (STT) was implemented from 1 July 2008 under the Securities Transfer Tax Act (2007) and Securities Transfer Tax Administration Act (2007). Simplistically, it is a tax of 0.25% on every transfer of a security. However, certain transactions such as \"shorting\" a share involve a usage of collateral instead of the actual security. When there is a transfer of collateral during a securities lending transaction, both income tax and securities transfer tax apply owing to the actual transfer of beneficial ownership. This tax was not changed in the 2020/21 budget.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Chunking Mechanism:\n",
    "- Tokenization: The text is first converted into tokens using the model's tokenizer (this splits text into word pieces/subwords). For example: \"Hello world\" might become [\"Hello\", \"world\"] while \"unhappiness\" might become [\"un\", \"##happiness\"]\n",

    "Transformer models (like all-mpnet-base-v2) have a maximum sequence length (often 512 tokens), 256 tokens is a safe middle ground because it’s small enough to avoid hitting the model’s max limit when combined with other text (e.g., prompts, queries) and it’s large enough to preserve meaningful context. If we set chunk_size=512, we risk hitting the model’s token limit if extra text is added laterand losing efficiency (longer chunks take more compute)."
